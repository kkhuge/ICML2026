# FedFRTH: Taming Heterogeneity with Fast Convergence and Enhanced Generalization

This repository contains the codes of the paper FedFRTH: Taming Heterogeneity with Fast Convergence and Enhanced Generalization

Our codes are based on the codes for the paper > [On the Convergence of FedAvg on Non-IID Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02189.pdf)

## Genarating the IID and non-IID data

```
cd data/cifar10
```
3. Running the `generate_cifar_iid.py` to obtain IID CIFAR-10 data while running `generate_dirichlet_distribution_niid.py` to obtain non-IID CIFAR-10 data.
4. Running the `generate_linear_regression_iid.py` to obtain IID mini-CIFAR-10 data while running `generate_linear_regression_niid.py` to obtain non-IID mini-CIFAR-10 data.

## Note
In our experiment, the number of clients is M=10, and all clients participated in each aggregation process.

If the next experiments using the SGD, you should set

```
cd src/models/client.py
self.train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True) 
self.test_dataloader = DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
```

If the next experiments using the GD, you should set

```
cd src/models/client.py
self.train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=Flase) 
self.test_dataloader = DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=Flase)
```

Before running the code, it is necessary to manually set and save the results, for example：running the `main.py` using the `fedavg5` trainer with different networks to obtain figure 1, you must modify the name of the saved file to distinguish among different networks or widths

```
# train the family of fully connected network
np.save(loss_dir + '/loss_test' + self.dataset + self.model + '_fc1', self.loss_list_test)
np.save(acc_dir + '/acc_test' + self.dataset + self.model + '_fc1', self.acc_list_test)
```


## Impact of Non-IID Versus Network Width

Running the `main.py` using the `fedavg5` trainer with different networks to obtain figure 1 and figure 2.

Running the `main.py` using the `fedavg4` trainer with different networks to obtain the variation of global NTK and parameters in figure 3 and running the `main.py` using the `fedavg12` trainer with different networks to obtain the variation of local NTK in figure 3.

## Linear Approximation of FedAvg

Running the `main.py` using the `fedavg9` trainer with the fully-connected networks to obtain figure 4.

## FedAvg Evolves as Centralized Learning

Running the `main.py` using the `fedavg11` trainer with the fully-connected networks to obtain figure 6.
